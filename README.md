Small programs to strengthen my ruby skills

### 1. Hashes Dictionary
A simple program to create a hash of words and their meanings.

### 2. Array based program
**Requirement**: I'm a client working for the Blank House. We want to display positive tweets about our president on our website. However, our president is kind of unpopular, and we pretty much only receive negative press. Write me a program that filters out the following words from tweets: "sucks", "bad", "hate", "foolish", and the most popular: "danger to society". Replace each negative word or phrase them with the word "CENSORED".Some test tweets have been provided for you.

### 3. Dice game
**Requirement** 
Write the dice game.
Upgrade the dice game: now both I and my opponent roll two six-sided dice each.
Upgrade the game once more: now we play several rounds for each game. The first player to win two rounds wins the game. (Still with two dice each.)

### 4. First Character of a String
I don't like my friend Sam, so much so that my hatred spills over to anyone with a first name beginning with 'S'. I want a program that, when anyone types their name in, shouts at them if their name begins with an 'S'. Anyone else should just get a friendly greeting.

### 5. Leap Years
A simple tool that will tell you whether a year is a leap year, it then takes an end year and returns an array of all the leap years between. It also returns the closest leap year to the given year (this could be before or after the given year).

### 6. Shoutify
Define a method on string instances, called shoutify. This method should return the string text in uppercase, with an extra exclamation mark on the end. In other words, "hello world".shoutify should return "HELLO WORLD!".

### 7. Text Based Adventure Game
The user starts by facing forward. They can move right, left, or forward. If they move right, they die (there's a goblin). If they move left, they die (there's a werewolf). If they move forward, they live. They have to do this twice to win.
